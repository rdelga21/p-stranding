  abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine how bilinguals' age at the time of language acquisition influenced the organization of their phonetic system(s). The productions of six English and five Korean vowels by English and Korean monolinguals were compared to the productions of the same vowels by early and late Korean-English bilinguals varying in amount of exposure to their second language. Results indicated that bilinguals' age profoundly influenced both the degree and the direction of the interaction between the phonetic systems of their native (L1) and second (L2) languages. In particular, early bilinguals manifested a bidirectional L1-L2 influence and produced distinct acoustic realizations of L1 and L2 vowels. Late bilinguals, however, showed evidence of a unidirectional influence of the L1 on the L2 and produced L2 vowels that were “colored” by acoustic properties of their L1. The degree and direction of L1-L2 influences in early and late bilinguals appeared to depend on the degree of acoustic similarity between L1 and L2 vowels and the length of their exposure to the L2. Overall, the findings underscored the complex nature of the restructuring of the L1-L2 phonetic system(s) in bilinguals.},

  abstract = {Purepecha has no grammatical gender, whereas Spanish has a binary masculine–feminine system. In this paper we investigate how early sequential Purepecha–Spanish bilinguals assign gender to Purepecha nouns inserted into an otherwise Spanish utterance, using a director-matcher production task and an online forced-choice acceptability judgement task. The results of the production task indicate a strong preference for masculine gender, irrespective of the gender of the noun’s translation equivalent, the so-called “masculine default” option. Participants in the comprehension task were influenced by the orthography of the Purepecha noun in the -a ending condition, leading them to assign feminine gender agreement to nouns that are masculine in Spanish, but preferred the masculine default strategy again in the -i/-u ending condition. The absence of the “analogical criterion” in both tasks contrasts with the results of some previous studies, underlining the need for more comparable data in terms of task type. Our results also highlight how task type can influence the choices speakers make, in this context, in terms of the choice of grammatical gender agreement strategy. Task type should therefore be carefully controlled in future studies.},

  urldate = {2023-05-12},
  abstract = {The current work is divided into two parts, both pertaining to the mixed Determiner Phrase (DP). The first half looks at the gender in the Spanish D + English N DP (e.g., la table). The second half focuses on the phonetics in the English D + Spanish N DP (e.g., the mesa). I delve into both parts in turn. In the first half, I propose a new way to account for the variability in gender in DPs like la table; that is, the quality of childhood input—what I call childhood input nouns—has a potential effect on the gender in mixed DPs. Some researchers have argued that bilingual speakers of Spanish and English have the following strategies when choosing gender in DPs like la table: the analogical criterion, the masculine default, and the phonological shape of the word (Burkholder, 2018; Liceras, Fuertes, Perales, Pérez- Tattam, \&amp; Spradlin, 2008; Otheguy \&amp; Lapidus, 2003; Valdés Kroff, 2016). While I do not completely abandon these tried and true strategies, I propose that heritage speakers of Spanish in Chicago will prefer the feminine determiner with nouns that have both, and not just one, of the following two characteristics: (i) the Spanish equivalent of the English noun is feminine, and (ii) the noun is what I call a childhood-input noun. As far as I am aware, this quality of childhood input has not been a variable that has been studied before. In order to test this new variable, 21 heritage speakers of Spanish in Chicago performed a Two-alternative Forced Choice task. They were given English sentences where the only switch was the Spanish determiner. Furthermore, the English nouns were: (i) feminine in Spanish and childhood-input nouns; (ii) feminine in Spanish non-childhood-input nouns; (iii) masculine in Spanish; and (iv) nonwords. The participants, then, had to choose what gender—whether masculine or feminine—they preferred with each stimulus noun. A frequentist analysis was performed. The results suggest that these participants significantly preferred the feminine Spanish determiner with the English nouns that were feminine in Spanish and were childhood-input nouns when compared to the other conditions, where the masculine was preferred. Thus, this experiment provides evidence that the childhood-input characteristic does indeed have an effect on the gender that is chosen in these mixed DPs. More importantly, these results suggest that there is evidence that the childhood-input characteristic of a word has an effect on the morphosyntactic flexibility of nouns whereby they can be used with feminine and masculine gender, as per López’s account. The second part of the dissertation focuses on the phonetics of DPs like the mesa. There has been a debate as to whether this DP is an acceptable switch (Moro, 2014, among others). Moro, for example, states that there must be feature checking between the noun and the determiner. In the case of the mesa, the noun has gender but the determiner does not. There is no feature checking, which leads to a crash in the derivation. However, this DP has been found, though infrequently, in natural speech corpora, as I demonstrate in this work. López (2020) proposes the following novel account: this DP is infrequent in production because it has a phonetic constraint that is motivated by the presence of a nominalizing n head with a gender feature. For a balanced bilingual population, this DP is an acceptable switch, but the entire DP must be pronounced with Spanish phonetics. López also considers “common currency” nouns, which are nouns that originated in Spanish but have become part of the English lexicon. According to López, these nouns have achieved full morphosyntactic flexibility whereby they can be pronounced with Spanish or English phonetics. In order to test López’s novel account, I analyzed two code-switching corpora—the Bangor Miami Corpus and the Multilingual Phonology Lab corpus—as well as testing heritage speakers of Spanish in Chicago using a Director-Matcher task. In the corpora I searched for the mixed DP of interest (e.g., the mesa). I also looked for monolingual Spanish DPs (e.g., la mesa) and monolingual English DPs (e.g., the table). I acoustically analyzed the vowel sound in the determiners and compared them to each other. According to López (2020), the mixed DP should be pronounced with Spanish phonetics, therefore similar to the Spanish monolingual DP. Through frequentist analysis, the normalized data showed that there was a significant difference between the mixed DP and the Spanish and English monolingual DPs. So, while the corpora data provided evidence for López’s account, there were some limitations. The number of tokens was small, and the acoustic quality of the recordings were not suitable for fine acoustic analysis. Therefore, experimental data was needed. I designed an experiment where 23 heritage speakers of Spanish in Chicago participated. They had to perform a modified Director-Matcher task. In this task, the participants produced the mixed DP (e.g., the mesa), monolingual Spanish DPs (e.g., la mesa), monolingual English DPs (i.e., the table), and complex DPs (i.e., the green mesa). Results from a Bayesian analysis showed that there was a significant difference between the pronunciation of the vowel sound in the determiner in the mixed DP and the English monolingual control, as well as the Spanish monolingual control. When it came to the adjective condition (e.g., the green mesa), it was significantly similar to the English monolingual control, but it was significantly different than the Spanish monolingual control. The “common currency” nouns were also analyzed. Qualitatively, the results supported López’s theory. Quantitatively, there was a low number of tokens, which could have affected the validity of the results from a Bayesian Analysis. The results provide partial support for López (2020) in that the participants did not pronounce the DP like their English, but it was also different than their Spanish. Further acoustic analysis of the nouns would be necessary to make a stronger claim. Results from both parts of this work provide evidence that López (2020) is the right framework to gain insight into the architecture of the bilingual mind.},

However, preliminary studies of Spanish suggest that children’s first articles appear in larger prosodic structures, possibly due to the higher frequency of longer words. To assess this issue, this study examined longitudinal data from two Spanish 1- to 2-year-olds. As expected, both produced their early articles with monosyllabic and disyllabic nouns, rapidly expanding article use to trisyllabic nouns as well. The results suggest that the prosodic complexity of the lexicon plays an important role in the development of prosodic structure, providing the context for early prosodic licensing of grammatical morphemes.},

Following this line of research, the present study investigates the role of code-switching and lexical stress on Spanish HS vowel production, specifically if the introduction of English reduces the vowel quality and duration of Spanish vowels after a code-switch. Eleven Spanish HSs participated in a controlled narration task in which they were asked to read aloud texts that code-switched between English and Spanish and one text that only contained Spanish. PRAAT was used to segment the vowels and the F1 and F2 values, along with duration, were extracted. The results show that both code-switching and lexical stress significantly affect Spanish HS vowels. Code-switching and vowels in unstressed position were more centralized than the vowels in the monolingual Spanish session and vowels in stressed position, respectively; unstressed vowels were also shorter in duration than stressed vowels. These results show that the introduction of English—a language in which vowel quality and duration change between unstressed and stressed syllables—via code-switching significantly affects Spanish HS vowels, subsequently providing evidence for transient interference.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This paper provides an overview of the Prosodic Transfer Hypothesis (PTH), which accounts for certain difficulties                     that learners experience with L2 morphosyntax. We focus on inflection and articles, which have often been accounted for through                     defective syntactic representations or problems with the interface between morphology and syntax (inflection) and between                     semantics or discourse/pragmatics and syntax (articles). We argue that some problems in these domains reflect transfer of L1                     prosodic constraints: certain forms cannot be prosodically represented as target-like and hence are omitted or mispronounced. We                     trace how the PTH has developed over time, from its initial instantiation as involving permanent L1 transfer, to currently, where                     L1 representations are seen as adaptable to the needs of the L2, and new representations can in fact be acquired. We provide an                     overview of work conducted in this framework and discuss how the theory has been extended beyond production to encompass                     comprehension and processing.},

  abstract = {Much current work assumes that “little v” (henceforth v) is a universal functional category directly involved in the building of predicates. As a functional category, one would expect v to be the locus of parametric variation, as predicted by Hagit Borer’s (1984) original hypothesis. Some analyses have shown that v is involved in parametric variation concerning Case (Legate 2008) and probably Object Shift (Chomsky 2001). In this article, we argue that v is also involved in other forms of cross-linguistic variation, thus extending parameter theory in some unexpected directions. In particular, we argue that v is involved in three different features of cross-linguistic variation: the order of verb and complements, their prosodic structure and the expression of focus/background articulation.}

  abstract = {Abstract             This article addresses methodological concerns in research on grammatical aspects of code-switching. Data from code-switching have the potential for a unique contribution to linguistics by giving us access to combinations of linguistic features that may be difficult (or impossible) to observe in monolingual data. Nonetheless, the use of code-switching data for linguistic inquiry is not without issues. In this paper, we focus on three methodological questions specific to code-switching research: (i) project design, (ii) experimental procedure and (iii) participant selection. Drawing on experimental data from both published works and in-progress projects, we highlight potential solutions to each methodological challenge, concluding that several solutions are often required to mitigate the impact of confounding variables. In line with previous work (e.g. Grosjean 1998, Gullberg, Indefrey \& Muysken 2009), we suggest that researchers clearly report on their methodology. Our overall goal is to contribute to a dialogue on best practices in code-switching research.},

  abstract = {This article provides initial evidence that the head K, which may spell out as case morphology, drives the operations of concord within the noun phrase. Evidence for this claim comes from three code-switching varieties: Basque/Spanish, German/Turkish and Russian/Kazakh. By placing the switch at the border between case morphology and the rest of the noun phrase the properties of K can be isolated and inspected. We find that if K is drawn from the lexicon of a non-concord language, constituents within the noun phrase adopt a default morphology. It is suggested that the data presented in this paper provide evidence for approaches that take Concord to be a form of Agree (probe, goal) and against an approach that takes it to be the result of feature percolation from the bottom up. An analysis of default morphology is proposed that argues that default forms are inserted as vocabulary items in syntactic terminals that, as a result of a failure of Agree, are populated with unvalued features.},

Two experiments were conducted. Experiment 1 tested whether Spanish intervocalic approximant (traditionally fricative) allophones of /b, d, g/ would occur in codeswitching contexts when situated between an English vowel and a Spanish vowel at word boundaries (e.g., Hablamos de mi ghost yesterday). Experiment 2 evaluated whether a word-initial English segment may serve as a trigger for Spanish /s/-voicing (e.g., mis ghosts) which shares its internal ranking with English. In Experiment 1 the Spanish process was not triggered on English words. In Experiment 2, a word-initial English voiced consonant was found to trigger voicing assimi-lation in Spanish. Results indicate that phonological processes accept triggers from another language at word boundaries, but do not modify structure crosslinguistically: Spanish phonological processes cannot be triggered to modify English segments. This generalization is true regardless of whether the specific process involves a ranking paradox (as in Experiment 1) or not (as in Experiment 2). Results support the conclusion that phonological rankings are contained within discretely represented phonological systems, and crosslinguistic differences among constraint rankings relevant to specific phonological processes are sufficient to constitute a ranking paradox for the purpose of the PF Interface Condition when the same constraints are ranked differently},

  abstract = {Aims and Objectives:               This study investigates the effects of code-switching on vowel quality, pitch and duration among English–French bilinguals. Code-switching has been claimed to influence the morphology, syntax and lexicon, but not the phonology of the switched language. However, studies on voice-onset time have found subtle phonetic effects of code-switching, even though there are no categorical phonological effects. We investigate this further through the following three questions: (1) Are F1 and F2 influenced in the process of code-switching? (2) Are code-switched words hyper-articulated? (3) Does code-switching have an effect on vowel duration before voiced and voiceless consonants?                                         Methodology:               To address our research questions we relied on an insertional switching method where words from one language were inserted into carrier phrases of the other to simulate English–French code-switching environments. Bilingual speakers were recorded while they read code-switched sentences as well as sentences that did not involve code-switching, that is, monolingual sentences.                                         Data and Analysis:               The vowels of target words in the recorded utterances were compared – code-switched contexts against monolingual contexts – for vocalic duration, F0, F1 and F2.                                         Findings/Conclusions:               Like previous voice-onset time studies, our results indicate that code-switching does not shift the phonology to that of the embedded language. We did, however, find subtle lower level phonetic effects, especially in the French target words; we also found evidence of hyper-articulation in code-switched words. At the prosodic level, target switch-words approached the prosodic contours of the carrier phrases they are embedded in.                                         Originality:               The approach taken in this study is novel for its investigation of vowel properties instead of voice-onset time.                                         Significance:               This new approach to investigating code-switching adds to our understanding of how code-switching affects pronunciation.},

Departing from Cuza’s (2013) and Depiante and Thompson’s (2013) research, the present study seeks to determine the extent to which this is possible in the case of Spanish as a heritage language. With this goal in mind, a total of thirty-three Spanish heritage speakers (divided into sequential and simultaneous bilinguals) and a comparison group of eleven late Spanish-English bilinguals completed a battery of off-line tasks that examined knowledge and use of preposition stranding (i.e., a syntactic construction whereby the object of the preposition is fronted while the preposition itself is left stranded), an understudied core syntactic phenomenon that is licit in English but precluded in Spanish. Overall findings reveal that the sequential heritage speakers pattern with participants from the control group. The simultaneous heritage speakers, on the other hand, seem to have a grammar that is not so restricting as they accept and produce ungrammatical cases of preposition stranding. Herein, we argue that these results do not obtain the way they do due to incomplete acquisition or L1 attrition but crucially because of the timing of exposure to the societal language. We propose that this property was completely acquired, although differently acquired due to the structural overlap observed between the two languages involved (e.g., Müller \& Hulk, 2001), and most importantly, to the timing of acquisition of English (e.g., Putnam \& Sánchez, 2013).},

Specifically, we examine the past and future of heritage Spanish phonetics/phonology at both the segmental (i.e., consonants and vowels) and suprasegmental (i.e., intonation, rhythm, stress) levels in terms of how this part of heritage Spanish grammars differs from that of other Spanish-speaking populations. Finally, we discuss a series of methodological factors to consider as investigators continue to advance this area of linguistic inquiry.},
